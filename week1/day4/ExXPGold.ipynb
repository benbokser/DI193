    "# The point of the exercise is to check if a person can retire depending on their age and their gender.\n",
    "# Note : Let’s say retirement age is 67 for men, and 62 for women (born after April, 1947).\n",

    "#     Hard-code the current year and month in your code (there are better ways of doing this, but for now it will be enough.)\n",
    "#     After calculating the age of a person, the function should return the age (the age is an integer).\n",
