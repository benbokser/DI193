    "    What is data analysis?\n",
    "\n",
    "Data analysis is the process of inspecting, cleaning, transforming, and modeling data with the goal of discovering useful information, informing conclusions, and supporting decision-making. It involves a variety of techniques and tools that range from basic statistical analysis to complex algorithms and predictive models. \n",
    "\n",
    "    Why is data analysis important in modern contexts?\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important in modern contexts because many modern contexts involve large amounts of data that can only properly be understood through data analysis techniques, while mere intuition would not lead to sufficient insights and could lead to incorrect conclusions. It is important for making well-informed decisions in many modern contexts.\n",
    "    List and describe three areas where data analysis is applied today.\n",
    "\n",
    "Three areas where data analysis is applied today are:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Business Strategy: helping businesses make data-driven decisions.\n",
    "    Scientific Research: guiding hypothesis testing and discovery.\n",
    "    Public Policy: assisting in the formulation of evidence-based policies.\n",
