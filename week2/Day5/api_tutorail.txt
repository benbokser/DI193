Menu - API documentation

You(send request) -> Waiter(takes request) -> Kitchen(receives request)

You(receives food) <- Waiter(takes food) <- Kitchen(send food)

Waiter == API
Kitchen == Server

json.loads

requests.get() # 90% of what you need

1. Write a URL -> "https://api.example.com/data"
2. You send the request -> requests.get(URL)
3. The server sends RESPONSE -> status code + JSON body
3. You parse the response -> response.json() -> Python dict!

Common request types:

GET - read / fetch data
POST - Send / create data
PUT - Update existing data
DELETE - remove data
